# Android-ToDo-App

This app is a simple ToDo list manager. The user is able to add new ToDo's by clicking on the bottomActionButton
and remove them by swiping left, algo, when deleted there is and Snackbar appearing at the bottom of the screen 
which shows an _UNDO_ option. Also, I have implemented a ToDo search bar which allows the user to navigate 
on his ToDo's.
